## Core Explanation
This question is a fit check. Good answers are authentic, specific, and tied to outcomes. Instead of abstract passion, show what parts of frontend work you consistently drive well and how that creates value for users and your team.

## Code Examples
```md
I enjoy turning ambiguous requirements into clear, accessible UI states.
In my last project, I redesigned an error-prone onboarding flow and cut support tickets by 22 percent.
```

## Implementation Note
A concise answer with one real example is stronger than a long list of interests.
