title: CSS Grid vs Flexbox Decision-Making
question: Explain the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox. When do you use which?
group: CSS Fundamentals & Systems
difficulty: Foundational
interviewSignal: Evaluates layout fundamentals and practical decision quality.
outcomes:
  - Distinguish one-dimensional and two-dimensional layout models.
  - Select layout tools based on content and behavior.
  - Combine Grid and Flexbox intentionally in the same interface.
keyConcepts:
  - Use Grid for two-dimensional page or component regions.
  - Use Flexbox for one-dimensional alignment and distribution within a row or column.
  - Choose based on layout intent first, then optimize for maintainability.
workflowSteps:
  - Identify whether the layout problem is one-dimensional or two-dimensional.
  - Sketch the layout regions and responsiveness requirements.
  - Implement the primary container with Grid or Flexbox.
  - Use the other system for nested alignment where it is stronger.
  - Verify behavior at key breakpoints and with real content.
practiceExercise: Build a dashboard shell with Grid for page regions and Flexbox for card header and action alignment.
pitfalls:
  - Forcing Flexbox to mimic full page grids with fragile width rules.
  - Overcomplicating small component alignment with Grid where Flexbox is simpler.
  - Ignoring intrinsic sizing and content overflow.
quiz:
  - question: You need a layout with header, sidebar, main content, and footer that repositions at tablet width. Which tool is usually the better first choice?
    answer: Grid, because this is a two-dimensional region layout with explicit area relationships.
    type: single
    options:
      - Flexbox
      - Grid
      - Floats
  - question: What is a strong signal that Flexbox should be your first choice?
    answer: The problem is primarily one-dimensional, such as distributing items in a row or column.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Can Grid and Flexbox be used together in the same UI?
    answer: Yes. A common pattern is Grid for macro layout and Flexbox inside components.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Why should layout intent come before tool preference?
    answer: Intent keeps the implementation predictable and maintainable as requirements evolve.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: What should you validate after selecting a layout system?
    answer: Responsive behavior, real content states, overflow, and alignment under edge cases.
    type: short
    options: []

  title: Multi-Team Analytics Dashboard Layout
  context: A dashboard needed stable page regions while allowing each team to ship independent widget cards.
  challenge: Early implementation used Flexbox for everything and became hard to maintain as regions multiplied.
  actions:
    - Switched top-level layout to Grid with named areas for header, nav, insights, and details.
    - Kept card-level alignment with Flexbox to simplify button and metadata spacing.
    - Added a breakpoint map showing how grid areas collapse on tablet and mobile.
    - Documented a rule of thumb for designers and engineers to keep layout decisions consistent.
  result: Reduced layout regressions in release QA and improved implementation speed for new dashboard sections.

## Core Explanation
Grid and Flexbox solve different layout classes. Grid excels at defining two-dimensional relationships (rows and columns at once), while Flexbox excels at one-dimensional flow and alignment. In practice, high-quality front-end systems use both: Grid for page-level regions and Flexbox for internal component alignment.

## Code Examples
```css
/* Two-dimensional shell with explicit areas */
.dashboard {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 18rem minmax(0, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "nav header"
    "nav content";
  min-height: 100vh;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.dashboard__nav {
  grid-area: nav;
}

.dashboard__content {
  grid-area: content;
}
```

```css
/* One-dimensional alignment inside a card header */
.card__header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.75rem;
}

.card__actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

## Implementation Note
When requirements change frequently, prefer the layout model that communicates intent most clearly to future teammates. Grid for structure, Flexbox for internal alignment, and clear boundaries between the two.
