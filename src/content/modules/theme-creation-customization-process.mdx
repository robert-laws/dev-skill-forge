title: Process for Creating and Customizing Themes
question: What is your process for creating and customizing themes?
group: CMS & Theming
difficulty: Intermediate
interviewSignal: Evaluates design-system thinking, implementation discipline, and maintainable theming.
outcomes:
  - Define a repeatable theming workflow from tokens to templates.
  - Balance brand customization with performance and accessibility.
  - Avoid theme drift with governance and documentation.
keyConcepts:
  - Themes scale better when built from tokens and reusable components.
  - Brand customization should not compromise accessibility or performance.
  - Upgrade-friendly overrides require strict boundary rules.
workflowSteps:
  - Gather brand requirements and content constraints.
  - Define token primitives for color, spacing, and typography.
  - Implement template and component-level theme overrides.
  - Validate across breakpoints, content states, and accessibility checks.
  - Document override strategy and maintenance ownership.
practiceExercise: Create a theming checklist for launching a second brand variant on an existing CMS platform.
pitfalls:
  - Hardcoding brand styles outside token systems.
  - Creating brittle template overrides that block upgrades.
  - Ignoring real content variability during theme QA.
quiz:
  - question: Why are design tokens central to a theme workflow?
    answer: They provide consistent, reusable style decisions across templates and components.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Which approach best supports long-term CMS upgrades?
    answer: Isolated, documented overrides with minimal core template modification.
    type: single
    options:
      - Direct edits to core templates everywhere
      - Isolated and documented override boundaries
      - Copying all base templates into the theme
  - question: What should be tested before theme release?
    answer: Responsive layouts, accessibility states, and content edge cases.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: What causes theme drift over time?
    answer: Untracked one-off style changes outside the token and component system.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Why document theming boundaries for teams?
    answer: Documentation keeps future customizations consistent and upgrade-safe.

  title: "Multi-Brand Theme Rollout"
  context: "A company launched a second brand and needed rapid theming without duplicating template logic."
  challenge: "Support brand differences while keeping shared components upgrade-friendly."
  actions:
    - "Introduced token-based color, spacing, and typography layers."
    - "Separated base templates from brand-specific overrides."
    - "Built responsive and accessibility QA checklists for each brand release."
    - "Documented override boundaries to prevent drift."
  result: "The second brand shipped quickly and subsequent updates remained maintainable across both themes."

## Core Explanation
Theme work is most reliable when it starts from a token system and clear override boundaries. A repeatable process makes it easier to launch brand variants without sacrificing accessibility, performance, or upgrade compatibility.

## Code Examples
```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #0e7490;
  --brand-surface: #ffffff;
  --brand-text: #1e1d1b;
}

.button-primary {
  background: var(--brand-primary);
  color: var(--brand-surface);
}
```

## Implementation Note
If a new brand requires heavy template rewrites, the base theming architecture is likely too rigid.
