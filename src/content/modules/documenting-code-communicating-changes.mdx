title: Documenting Code and Communicating Changes
question: How do you document your code or communicate changes for team members?
group: Workflow, Reliability & Collaboration
difficulty: Foundational
interviewSignal: Evaluates collaboration quality and maintainability habits.
outcomes:
  - Choose documentation formats by audience and lifecycle stage.
  - Write effective PRs and change summaries.
  - Reduce team ambiguity with lightweight standards.
keyConcepts:
  - Documentation should reduce ambiguity at handoff points.
  - Change communication must include risk and verification details.
  - Documentation quality is measured by usability, not length.
workflowSteps:
  - Add code comments only where intent is not obvious.
  - Write pull request summaries with context, scope, and test evidence.
  - Capture architectural decisions in an ADR when tradeoffs are significant.
  - Update changelog or release notes for user-visible behavior.
  - Review docs during code review to prevent drift.
practiceExercise: Write a pull request summary for a risky frontend refactor including test coverage and rollback notes.
pitfalls:
  - Treating documentation as an afterthought after merge.
  - Writing comments that restate obvious code.
  - Omitting risk and validation details from change summaries.
quiz:
  - question: What is the primary purpose of technical documentation in teams?
    answer: To reduce confusion, transfer intent, and support safe future changes.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Which PR detail most helps reviewers evaluate risk?
    answer: A clear summary of behavior changes and validation evidence.
    type: single
    options:
      - Number of files changed only
      - Behavior changes plus test evidence
      - Commit timestamps only
  - question: When should you create an ADR?
    answer: When a decision has meaningful long-term architectural consequences.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: Why keep changelog entries concise?
    answer: Concise entries are easier to scan and more likely to stay updated.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: What prevents documentation drift most effectively?
    answer: Making documentation updates part of the definition of done.

  title: "Frontend Refactor Communication Standard"
  context: "Large UI refactors caused confusion because PR context and rollout risk were not documented consistently."
  challenge: "Reduce ambiguity for reviewers and on-call engineers without adding heavy process overhead."
  actions:
    - "Introduced a PR template with problem, change, risk, and validation sections."
    - "Required ADRs for high-impact architectural shifts."
    - "Aligned release notes with user-facing behavior changes."
    - "Added doc-review checks to pull request acceptance criteria."
  result: "Review turnaround improved and production rollout surprises decreased after adoption."

## Core Explanation
Clear documentation and communication reduce delivery risk and onboarding cost. Good teams document decisions at the level of intent and impact, not line-by-line mechanics. The strongest habit is linking every change to context, validation, and operational risk.

## Code Examples
```md
## Pull Request Summary
- Problem: Checkout validation was inconsistent across forms.
- Change: Replaced per-form validators with shared schema validation.
- Risk: Potential error message regressions.
- Validation: Unit tests, integration tests, and manual keyboard flow checks.
```

## Implementation Note
If someone cannot review or operate your change without a meeting, your documentation is incomplete.
