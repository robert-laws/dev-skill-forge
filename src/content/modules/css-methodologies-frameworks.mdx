title: CSS Methodologies and Framework Choices
question: What CSS methodologies or frameworks have you used (e.g., BEM, Tailwind, Bootstrap)?
group: CSS Fundamentals & Systems
difficulty: Intermediate
interviewSignal: Evaluates system thinking, maintainability strategy, and team scalability.
outcomes:
  - Compare BEM, utility-first, and component-library approaches.
  - Select a CSS strategy based on team constraints.
  - Define migration and governance patterns for styling systems.
keyConcepts:
  - Styling choices should optimize maintainability over short-term speed.
  - Naming conventions and token systems reduce style drift.
  - Mixed approaches work only with explicit boundaries.
workflowSteps:
  - Assess team size, product complexity, and release cadence.
  - Choose a primary styling pattern and document rules.
  - Define design tokens for spacing, color, and typography.
  - Add linting and code review checks for consistency.
  - Revisit strategy after major product or team shifts.
practiceExercise: Propose a styling strategy for a multi-team SaaS dashboard and justify where BEM, utility classes, or component libraries fit.
pitfalls:
  - Allowing multiple patterns without agreed boundaries.
  - Optimizing for initial speed while ignoring long-term complexity.
  - Treating a framework as a substitute for design-system decisions.
quiz:
  - question: What is a main benefit of utility-first CSS in large codebases?
    answer: It can speed implementation and reduce custom stylesheet sprawl when conventions are enforced.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: When is BEM most valuable?
    answer: When teams need predictable naming and explicit component boundaries.
    type: single
    options:
      - Only for tiny prototypes
      - For maintainable component-oriented CSS
      - Only when using CSS-in-JS
  - question: Why should design tokens accompany any CSS methodology?
    answer: Tokens centralize core decisions and keep styles consistent across components.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: What risk appears when teams mix Tailwind and custom semantic classes freely?
    answer: Inconsistent patterns and rising maintenance overhead.
    type: short
    options: []
  - question: What is a healthy way to evaluate a CSS framework?
    answer: Measure delivery speed, maintainability, onboarding cost, and bundle impact.

caseStudy:
  title: "Multi-Product Styling Consolidation"
  context: "Three product teams used different CSS styles, causing inconsistent UI behavior and slower onboarding."
  challenge: "Unify styling practices without forcing a full rewrite of mature interfaces."
  actions:
    - "Defined shared tokens for color, spacing, and typography."
    - "Set BEM for legacy components and utility-first patterns for new feature teams."
    - "Introduced stylelint rules and PR review checklist for architecture consistency."
    - "Created migration playbooks by component risk level."
  result: "Design drift slowed, review quality improved, and teams shipped new UI with fewer style regressions."

## Core Explanation
No single CSS approach is universally best. The right choice depends on how your team ships, reviews, and maintains UI over time. Mature teams select a default pattern, enforce it with tooling, and only deviate where there is clear justification.

## Code Examples
```css
/* BEM */
.card__title {
  margin-block-end: 0.5rem;
}

/* Utility-first (conceptual) */
/* <h2 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Title</h2> */
```

## Implementation Note
The best methodology is the one your team can apply consistently six months later.
